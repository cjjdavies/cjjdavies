**From 2025 I'll be moving some projects to Codeberg, others to a private server, and not maintaining or updating anything here, unless it's work-related.**
- 👋 Hi, I’m Chantel and I work for Bradford Council as a Data Scientist in the NIHR Health Determinants Research Collaborative team
- 👀 I’m interested in building websites and dashboards, using various tools to make them look nice. I also really like maths, statistics and probability theory, GIS applications and understanding how things work.
- 🌱 I mostly work in R/ RStudio, sometimes including elements of HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Python, Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects on food, farming, land use and mental health.
